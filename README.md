# A--I WAR

## Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLrQPF6p2Xk&t=10s

# Description:

    A retro game of Pong mix with a retro famous movie, named War games. 
    As well as The Knightrider theme in the background. 
    The object of the game is to defeat an evil computer named Copytron. 
    An A.I made by Dwight K. Schrute (from The Office).
    
    You must defeat Copytron by playing a game of pong. 
    If you lose, Copytron takes over The World! 
    But if you win, you successfully saved the human race! 
    You can start by picking one out of 3 levels that you can choose to play against Copytron. (EASY, HARD, IMPOSSIBLE)
    Then you can pick which side you wanna play on.(LEFT OR RIGHT)
    Also you can pick which two buttons you wanna play with.( W,S or UP, DOWN)
    It is up to you how you wanna play  and the World is in your hands!
    
    Now my project contains 8 files.
    Those 8 files are sounds, Ball, Class, Copytron, Font, Main, Paddle and Push.
    Each file is important to the program. 
    It's what makes the program run smoothly and unique
    Without these files, the game would not work.
    
    Especially, files named Paddle, Ball, Class, sounds and CopyTron.
    Could you imagine a game of Pong without paddles?!
    There would just be a Ball flying around.
    You would be unable to score or defend your side.
    As well as the Game being unenjoyable.
    
    It is the same concept, if you didn't add the Ball file too.
    There would just be paddles.
    No purpose for the game, just some paddles going up and down.
    Also, it would be quite dull and unpleasent if there were no sounds included in the game.
    The sounds file inclues the Knight Rider theme, paddle hits, scores, wall hits and most important Copytron.
    An A.I voice that I have create myself.
    There's also another file named Copytron that has codes and fonts to the game.
